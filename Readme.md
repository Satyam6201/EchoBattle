## 🚀 How to Run

### ✅ 1. Compile Everything
```bash
javac common/*.java server/*.java client/*.java
```

### ✅ 2. Start Servers in Separate Terminals
```bash
java server.GameServer         # Starts on port 5000
java server.VoiceServer        # Starts on port 6000
java server.LeaderboardServer  # Starts on port 7000
```

### ✅ 3. Start Clients
```bash
java client.GameClient         # For each player
java client.VoiceClient        # For each player (optional)
java client.LeaderboardClient  # To view game results
```

You need **two terminals for each player** (Game + Voice client).

## 🌐 Network Notes
- Default IP is `localhost`. To play over LAN, replace `localhost` with the host's IP address.
- Each server binds to a specific port:
  - `GameServer`: `5000`
  - `VoiceServer`: `6000`
  - `LeaderboardServer`: `7000`

Use different ports if you get `Address already in use` error.

---

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

❌ `java.net.BindException: Address already in use`  
➡ Another app is using the port. Run:
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :5000   # Then kill the PID using task manager
```

❌ `Voice not working`  
➡ Ensure microphone access is enabled. Check Java permissions or test in another voice app.
